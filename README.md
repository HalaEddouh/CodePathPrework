## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps: 
`
Netflix:
-Organized
-Visually appealing, always coming up with a way to make film covers flow with the next.

Amazon:
-Organized.
-Great recommendations.

Apple Music:
-Organized.
-Can make it visually appealing.

An app I would love to create is a 'Favorites' app one could share with their friends. It would be a customizable app full of tabs which are filled with one's favorites, ranging from clothing stores to coffee shops. In the app one could also upload photos and share it with their added friends.


## Notes

A challenge I had diffculty with was connecting my action binding to the changeBackground function. I had previously deleted my button and redid it, doing so I had multiple old actions.
